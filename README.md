# Kung_Fu_Escape
A little Arduboy game I wrote trying to channel the Kung-Fu Master arcade game for my 7 year old Stepson.

Very easy to play. Just direction buttons to walk and A and B buttons to either fly kick or normal kick. You can also press down to crouch and hit attack to do a low blow.
Give it a go :)
